Hell Cat will be on either left or right side of the bed. He will approach closer phase by phase when looking at him. Flash him to push him back until he can't anymore. If he's pushed back all the way and not looked at, he will eventually switch sides. When Rat goes under the bed, Cat will attack! Flash him and be as quick as you can! He will eventually crouch and go under the bed. He will eventually get out of the bed and repeat.
