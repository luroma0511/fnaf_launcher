Shadow Rat will quickly enter from the doors. Stall him to prevent his entry. Once he enters, you must flash him as much as you can. He will also teleport to other sides of the room. If you flash him enough, he'll go under the bed. Find where he is, then go to the opposite side. Once he peaks out, flash him immediately to make him leave.
