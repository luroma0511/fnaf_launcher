Shadow Cat will be under the bed. Find where he is, then go to the opposite side. Once he peaks out, flash him to make him go to another side of the room before he attacks. He will also teleport to other sides of the room. Flash him as much as you can until he leaves. He will eventually come back from either side of the bed. Flash him to make him go under the bed and repeat.
