Cat will come from either side of the bed. Flash him to make him go under the bed. Find where he is, then go to the opposite side. He will eventually come out of the bed and do a room attack. Once he peaks out, flash him, and he'll eventually go to another side of the room before he attacks. Flash him as much as you can until he leaves.
