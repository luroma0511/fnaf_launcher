Shadow Rat will enter from the doors. You must stall him at the corresponding side he's knocking. After stalling him enough times, he'll enter the room and perform a room attack. After he goes down the bed, find where he is and then go to the opposite side. Once he peaks out, flash him immediately to make him leave."
