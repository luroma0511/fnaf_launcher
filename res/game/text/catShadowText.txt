Shadow Cat will enter from the doors. You must stall him in the correct order of his knocking pattern. After stalling him correctly, he'll enter the room and go under the bed. After he goes down the bed, find where he is and then go to the opposite side. He will eventually come out of the bed and do a room attack. Flash him enough to make him leave.
